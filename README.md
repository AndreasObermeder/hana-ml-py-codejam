# CodeJam - Getting Started with Machine Learning using SAP HANA and Python

## Description

This repository contains the material for the CodeJam on Getting Started with Machine Learning using SAP HANA and Python. 

In this CodeJam you will learn how the Machine Learning process develops using a Python Client for SAP HANA.

## Overview sessions

These recorded sessions are optional, but are available should you be interested to get an overview ahead of the event, or after the event to recap.

1. [Build your Machine Learning Scenario for your SAP HANA Cloud application from Python - Devtoberfest'22](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/build-your-machine-learning-scenario-for-your-sap-hana-cloud/ev-p/9071)
1. [Accelerate your Machine Learning efforts - benefit from SAP HANA Cloud AutoML - SAP Community Call](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/sap-community-calls/accelerate-your-machine-learning-efforts-benefit-from-sap-hana/ec-p/124250#M84)
 
## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository, including hardware and software, are detailed in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

### Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises. Each exercise is a notebook to be executed.

### Following the exercises

During the CodeJam you will complete each exercise one at a time. During each exercise there are discussion points to be discussed with the entire CodeJam class, led by the instructor and marker as "ðŸ¤“ **Let's discuss**"

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can find out more about the subject that was covered. That way we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).
