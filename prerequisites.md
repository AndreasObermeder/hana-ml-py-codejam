# Prerequisites

There are hardware, software and service prerequisites for participating in this SAP CodeJam. 

The approach assumed for the participants is that exercises will be executed using [SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/sap-business-application-studio/what-is-sap-business-application-studio) as the development tool. 

If you are experienced in using Jupyter or Microsoft VSCode, then you could execute exercises locally on your own computer, but the setup for this is outside of the scope of this material.
