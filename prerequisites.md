# Prerequisites

There are hardware, software and service prerequisites for participating in this SAP CodeJam. The general approach assumed for the participants is that exercises will be executed using [SAP Business Application Studio](https://community.sap.com/topics/business-application-studio) as the development tool. 

However, if you are an experienced developer, you can also execute them locally on your own computer using JupyterLab or Microsoft VSCode.
